# Catstagram

In this practice, you'll be building a multi-day project called Catstagram!

## Background and Context

Here are the features of Catstagram:

- It shows a random kitten picture from the `https://thecatapi.com/` API.
- Users can vote on the picture.
- Users can comment on the picture.
- Users can delete comments.
- Users can request a new random kitten image to be shown.

The most important feature of Catstagram is that all of the other features
listed above can be performed without requiring a page reload. For example,
when a new comment is created, the comment smoothly gets added to the page
without requiring the website to reload.

In building Catstagram, you will master the fundamentals of interacting with
APIs and implementing DOM manipulation behaviors in response to API calls.
This project will be a 3 day project.

## Phases

1. Fetch a new cat image on page load and display it
2. Add interactivity to the page with buttons and forms
3. Store the application state on the client

## Extras

1. I drew the icon of the black cat bouncing
2. I added a random username list, every time you type a new comment it randomly selects it, as well as chooses a random color for the username and comment
3. randomly generated number of likes
4. added click animation for thumbs up and heart

   # future updates 
6. I hope to implement a web nav bar on top
7. I hope to be able to generate containers of the cat as you scroll down
8. I would like to create a login page so you can have a username and own profile page when clicking on the profile icon
